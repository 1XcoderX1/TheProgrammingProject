## Homework:

###1 PrinterWriter class

What I did first is to create a "while" loop and inside it I created the Scanner object so it reads continuosly from the console.

Then I made a string so it can go to the next line of the console, and then it writes in the file.
Afterwards I made an "if" statement to check when the user types "out", and when it does it closes the scanner and the action of writing on the text file.
But, when I closed the stream, I got an exception and I handle it.
But, I could not separate the lines in time.

##2 JVM roll
