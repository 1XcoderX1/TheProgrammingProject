# Homework
 
1. You have to complete what we started in the lecture. You saw the working of threads and now you should know when someone refers to sockets in java.
       The exercise is to make a Restaurant-customer system. In this system, the Restaurant will run as the server. Multiple customers will be able to connect to the restaurant and send orders in the form of integers. The restaurant should read the integer and then send them back to the customers. The customer and the restaurant should be notified of the sending and receiving.

2. Please ask me if you feel any trouble!
   
   
## BEST OF LUCK!
 
P.S. You can start with my classes as the base or create the whole system yourself. Keep in mind that the data streams we created only write and read integers currently.
