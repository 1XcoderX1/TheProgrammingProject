# My Programming project
------
1. We created two clases called Simple and SimpleTest. We created a method called Sum, and then we tested it in the SimpleTest, creating an object which called the method from the Simple class. The SimpleTest class had the main method.

## Homework(Due 1600 on 24/02/17)

    * Modify the Simple class, so that it has 4 methods. One for addition, one for substraction, one for multiplication and one for division. The  methods should take two doubles and output a double. 
    
    * Test your Simple class thoroughly in a SampleTest class.
