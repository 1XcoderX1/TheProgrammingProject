# Marking: 

1. As you have used BufferedReader I am going to mark this assignment in this way.
    
    I will mark your Printer solution as it is. But, thise marks will not be aded to your total score as you did not use the Reader as in the instructions. If you resubmit the homework before 5th March, midnight, with the FileReader, the score for that will be added to your total score.

2. The Calculator class works perfectly, and I am happy with how you approached the problem directly. But, if the user      types something else other than the listed operations, nothing happens. It would have been better if something like      "undefined input" would have been outputted to the user. Other than that, flawless.
