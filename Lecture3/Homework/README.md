## Homework

 1. Create a class called Printer that takes the first line from a text file and then prints it. The class should take 
    the 'characters' one by one. I suggest using the 'FileReader' class as we dd in the class, but you guys can use 
    any byteInputStream class you want to. 
    
 2. Create a Calculator class that takes three arguments from the command line. The first argument should be "sum",
    "substract", "divide" or "multiply". The other 2 arguments should be doubles that will be used to do the operation 
    specified in the first argument. The class should output the operation done and the result of the output. It depends
    on you what methods you create, and what constrctors you use to do this in your class.
