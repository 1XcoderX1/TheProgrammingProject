# Homework 1

I created one class called Calculator, where I made four methods. After this I made another class called CalculatorTest, where you can find the main method. In this class I called the methods from the Calculator class using one object. Then I just printed out the methods.


# Feedback

* The class Calculator is perfect. It has all the methods that were specified in the assignment. One improvement that could have been done in
  the divide method would have been to check if the denomitor is zero, then some error is displayed on the console saying for example -   
  "Cannot divide by zero". Apart from that everythng is perfect in the Calculator class.  
    
* In the test class, from next time, try to input numbers in the methods so that they can work if I run the test class.
  More info on this in the next session.
    
    
## GREAT WORK. KEEP IT UP!
