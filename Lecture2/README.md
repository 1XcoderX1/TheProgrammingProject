# What we did in Lecture2.

I learnt how to use constructors, in which I assigned some parameters. We also used an if statement to check some conditions.
After creating the constructor, we modified the object from the CalculatorTest class in such way that the new object had to had assigned values according to the parameters of the constructor.
Then we call the method from the Calculator class.
Moreover, calculator.sum(); is a String, because when we call the method, the output will be a String.
