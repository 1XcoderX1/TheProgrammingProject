# Homework (Due 1600 25/02/17)

* Create a new Calculator class that must have atleast one constructor. The calculator class should enable me to add, substract, multiply and         divide. I should be able to put a string in the contructor while creating an object that specifies my intent to add, substract, multiply or         divide. Apart from that, the object should accept the two doubles I need to perform the calculation. You can accomplish this task any way you       want to using constructors.

* Thoroughly test this class in a CalculatorTest class.
