# Exercise 2 for Homework

I created two classes, one called Calculator and the other one called CalculatorTest(where the main method is).
I made only one constructor, with three parameters: one string and two doubles.
Then I created four methods (sum, substraction, multiplication, division). In each of them, there are if statements checking if the String is equal to: sum, substraction, multiplication or division. Then it out prints the result of the appropiate operation.
In the CalcultorTest class I assigned values to three variables (which can be changed, according to what you would like to calculate). Then I made an object which accepts the input of the three variables. 
After that I called the four methods from the Calculator class, which will output the result of whatever calculation you want.
